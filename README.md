Android App - VOLUME CALCULATOR APP

Description
I developed an Android application using Kotlin and XML in Android Studio, focusing on both functionality and user experience.  
The user interface was built using XML and follows Material Design guidelines to ensure a clean and engaging look.
This project allowed me to strengthen my Android development skills, focusing on both frontend UI design and backend functionality using modern Android architecture components.

App Overview

The Volume Calculator App is an Android application that allows users to calculate the volume of various geometric shapes, including cones, cubes, cuboids, cylinders, prisms, and spheres. The app takes input dimensions from the user and provides the calculated volume for the selected shape.

Technical Requirements

Backend: The app uses Java to create a calculation logic for each geometric shape, using mathematical formulas to calculate the volume based on the input dimensions.
Frontend: The user interface is designed using XML, which includes a layout with input fields for the dimensions, a shape selection dropdown, and a text view to display the calculated volume.
Data Storage: No local data storage is required, as the app performs calculations in real-time based on user input.

Key Features

Multi-Shape Support: The app supports calculation of volume for multiple geometric shapes, including cones, cubes, cuboids, cylinders, prisms, and spheres.
Real-time Calculation: The app performs calculations in real-time, providing instant results as the user inputs the dimensions.
Error Handling: The app includes error handling to handle cases such as invalid user input, ensuring that the app remains stable and user-friendly.
Shape-Specific Calculations

Cone: The app uses the formula V = (1/3)πr²h to calculate the volume of a cone, where r is the radius and h is the height.

Cube: The app uses the formula V = s³ to calculate the volume of a cube, where s is the side length.

Cuboid: The app uses the formula V = lwh to calculate the volume of a cuboid, where l is the length, w is the width, and h is the height.

Cylinder: The app uses the formula V = πr²h to calculate the volume of a cylinder, where r is the radius and h is the height.

Prism: The app uses the formula V = lwh to calculate the volume of a prism, where l is the length, w is the width, and h is the height.

Sphere: The app uses the formula V = (4/3)πr³ to calculate the volume of a sphere, where r is the radius.
